#  StudyTime
StudyTime helps students form and keep study habits.

StudyTime allows you to set goals for how long you will study each week for a course.  StudyTime then
tracks your progress on achieving those goals.  StudyTime senses the places and times that you usually study
for particular courses and can send you a notification reminding you to study.  StudyTime even works on your
watch!
